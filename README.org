* What's this?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       82195f31-e674-44a4-9ea8-cfd4c9e50f76
  :END:

A not-so-hurt-yet-still-make-kind-of-sense emacs configuration set, c/w a bunch of packages.

* Goal

  :END:

  1. Any specific {package,variable} config should be found *no more than
     2 layers* down from =init.el=.
  2. I will *not* focus on "startup speed", since daemonize Emacs is
     all you need.

* Usage

   There is a customize group called =nema= to give you a few customization options. Remember to restart emacs
   if anything is changed.
     - =nema-use-evil= :: Whether or not to use evil-mode. Default to =nil=.
          My evil-mode intergration is at a very basic level (since I don't use evil-mode). Any pull request is welcomed.
     - =nema-emacs-completion-engine= :: Choose between =ivy=, =helm=, =vertico= and =ido=. Default to =ivy=
     - =nema-lsp= :: Use LSP or not. Remember to follow server installation instructions below. Default to =nil=
     - =nema-theme= :: Choose one theme from given pre-defined themes list.
     - =nema-theme-style= :: Switch between dark and light mode of your theme (if supported).
     - =nema-mode-line= :: Choose which mode line to use.

 There are many ways to hack this. You can
 1. Write your ELisp in =.emacs.d/my/*.el=. They will be loaded after all =nema-*= modules are loaded.
    - Your YAS snippets will be saved and loaded in =.emacs.d/my/snippets/**/*=. (See =nema-snippet.el=)
    - =.emacs.d/my/**/*= is in =.gitignore= list. So you can save sensitive data
      (e.g. IRC login info or Mail account) or some machine-specific configs (e.g. if you have a HiDPI laptop
      and a workstation with normal DPI displays) without syncing across with VCS.
    - I've written some maybe-useful scripts in =my-sample/*.el=. Symlink (or copy) them into your =my/= folder to
      enable them.
 2. Fork me.

* LSP server installation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       ef25f462-f4dc-4b9f-ade4-46263eeed5bf
  :END:
  See [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages][lsp-mode supported languages]]
* Known issues

  :END:
  1. If it is run at its first time, make sure not to use =emacs --server=, since it may prompt you
     of Elisp-enabled themes warning or native plugin compilation. Use =emacs= or =emacs -nw= instead,
     and press =y= if prompted. When =.emacs.d/custom.el= is built, you can use server mode without problem.
